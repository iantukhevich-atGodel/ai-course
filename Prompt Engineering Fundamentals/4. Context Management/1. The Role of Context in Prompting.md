<h1>The Role of Context in Prompting</h1>
<p>
	Context in prompting refers to the background information and surrounding instructions provided to the model to guide its responses. Without context, even a well-structured prompt can produce outputs that are incomplete, misleading, or irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if you ask a model to “Generate test cases,” it cannot know the exact feature, system behavior, or constraints unless this information is supplied. In QA and testing workflows, context is critical: it ensures that generated test cases align with the feature specification and the expected environment.
</p>
<ul>
	Providing context can take several forms:
	<li>
		A brief description of the system or feature.
	</li>
	<li>
		Requirements or acceptance criteria for a specific task.
	</li>
	<li>
		Previous outputs or decisions that the model should consider.
	</li>
</ul>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Feature: Password reset page with email verification.
Task: Generate 5 test cases covering valid and invalid scenarios.
Constraints: Output in table format with columns: Input, Steps, Expected Result.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Here, the model receives enough context to produce test cases that are meaningful and relevant, rather than generic or incomplete.
