<h1>Providing Background Knowledge</h1>
<p>
	Sometimes, models may lack specific domain knowledge or understanding of your environment. Providing background knowledge explicitly can greatly improve output quality.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Background: The system is a web application with OAuth2 authentication and multi-factor login.
Task: Generate edge-case test scenarios for login functionality.
Constraints: Present results in a table with Input, Steps, and Expected Result.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	By including background knowledge, the model can reason more accurately about the task and produce results that align with your system’s behavior. Without such context, it might generate test cases for generic login systems that do not match your environment.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Tip:</b>
	Provide concise, precise background information that is directly relevant to the task. Avoid overloading the model with unnecessary details that could confuse the output.
