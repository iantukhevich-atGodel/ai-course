<h1>Understanding Prompt Failures</h1>
<p>
	Prompt failures occur when the model produces outputs that do not meet expectations. These failures can be subtle, such as incomplete test cases, inconsistent formatting, or outputs that miss key conditions, or they can be obvious, such as entirely irrelevant responses. Understanding why a prompt fails is the first step toward fixing it.
</p>
<p>
	Common causes include ambiguous instructions, missing context, overly complex or overloaded prompts, and unrealistic assumptions about what the model “knows.” In QA workflows, such failures can lead to test cases that are unusable or inaccurate, which could result in missed defects or false positives.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<br>
<p>
	Suppose you instruct the model:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
Generate test cases for a login feature.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The output might include basic cases, but could omit edge cases like SQL injection attempts or blank input scenarios. Here, the failure arises because the prompt lacks specificity, context, and structured guidance.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Key insight:</b>
	Prompt failures are often a reflection of the prompt’s clarity, completeness, and structure, not a limitation of the model itself. Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective debugging.
