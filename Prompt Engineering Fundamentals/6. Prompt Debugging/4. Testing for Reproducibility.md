<h1>Testing for Reproducibility</h1>
<p>
	A well-debugged prompt should produce consistent results across multiple runs. Reproducibility testing involves running the same prompt multiple times and comparing outputs. If outputs vary widely, it indicates that the prompt may be too vague or that the model is relying on randomness to fill in gaps.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Example:</b>
	A prompt for generating test cases is run three times. Each output has different numbers of test cases and inconsistent formatting. This signals that the instructions are not precise enough, and further refinement is needed to constrain the output reliably.
</p>
<p>
	Testing reproducibility is critical in QA workflows because inconsistent outputs can lead to gaps in coverage, missed defects, or unreliable automated test scripts.
