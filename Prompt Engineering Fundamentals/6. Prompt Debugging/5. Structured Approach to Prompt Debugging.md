<h1>Structured Approach to Prompt Debugging</h1>
<ol>
	<p>
		Effective prompt debugging follows a structured approach:
	</p>
	<li>
		<b>
			Review the prompt:
		</b>
		Identify ambiguous instructions, missing context, or conflicting requirements.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Analyze the output:
		</b>
		Compare against expectations and identify gaps or errors.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Adjust iteratively:
		</b>
		Add specificity, context, role assignments, or constraints to address observed issues.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Test reproducibility:
		</b>
		Run the refined prompt multiple times to ensure consistent outputs.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Document lessons learned:
		</b>
		Record changes and observed improvements for future reference.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	By treating prompt debugging as a structured workflow, QA engineers and SDETs can reliably produce high-quality outputs and integrate prompt-driven tasks into automated pipelines or other workflows.
