<h1>Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h1>
<p>
	Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to reason step by step before giving a final answer. Instead of producing a result in a single step, the model is guided to explain its reasoning, which improves accuracy for complex or multi-step tasks.
</p>
<p>
	This approach is especially valuable in QA or testing scenarios where multiple conditions or edge cases must be considered. By breaking down reasoning, the model is less likely to skip steps or overlook important factors.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Task: Determine boundary test cases for a password reset form.
Prompt: Think step by step. First, list all possible inputs a user can provide. Next, identify invalid or edge-case inputs. Finally, describe expected system behavior for each case.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Chain-of-thought prompting not only produces more complete outputs, but also allows learners to see the modelâ€™s reasoning process. This is useful for reviewing and validating results before integrating them into real workflows.
