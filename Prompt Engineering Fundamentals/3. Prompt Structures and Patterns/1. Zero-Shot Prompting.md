<h1>Zero-Shot Prompting</h1>
<p>
	<b>Zero-shot prompting</b>
	is the simplest approach: the model is asked to complete a task 
	<b>without any examples</b>. 
	The model relies entirely on the instructions provided in the prompt.
</p>
<p>
	While this approach is fast and requires minimal setup, it can be unpredictable. If the instructions are vague or complex, the model may produce incomplete or inconsistent results. Zero-shot prompting works best when the task is clearly defined and the expected format is straightforward.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Example:</b>
	 Suppose you want to generate test cases for a login page. A zero-shot prompt might be:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
Write five test cases for a login page. Include positive and negative scenarios. Present them in a table with columns: Input, Steps, Expected Result.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	This prompt communicates the task clearly, but the model has no examples to imitate. As a result, subtle differences in phrasing can lead to variation in the outputs.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Key takeaway:</b>
	Zero-shot is suitable for simple, well-defined tasks, but becomes less reliable as the complexity of the task increases.
