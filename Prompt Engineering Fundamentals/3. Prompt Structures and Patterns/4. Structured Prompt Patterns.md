<h1>Structured Prompt Patterns</h1>
<p>
	Structured prompt patterns are reusable templates designed to improve output reliability and efficiency. They combine elements like instructions, roles, constraints, and optional examples into a consistent format that the model can follow.
</p>
<p>
	These patterns are particularly useful for QA engineers and SDETs, where tasks such as generating test cases, bug reports, or code review checklists need to be repeated reliably. A structured pattern reduces variation and increases the likelihood that outputs meet expectations.
</p>
<b>Example Pattern:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Act as [role]. 
Your task: [task description]. 
Use the following format: [output format]. 
Constraints: [constraints]. 
Example: [optional few-shot examples].
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	By adapting this template for different tasks, you can quickly create reliable prompts without rewriting instructions from scratch. The same pattern can be applied across multiple features or domains.
</p>
<p>
	Tip: Start simple with role + task + format, then add constraints or examples as needed to improve output quality.
