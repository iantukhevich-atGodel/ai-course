<h1>Few-Shot Prompting</h1>
<p>
	<b>Few-shot prompting</b>
	 addresses the limitations of zero-shot prompting by providing examples alongside the instructions. The model can then infer the pattern or style you expect, which significantly increases consistency.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, in QA, you may want the model to produce test cases following a certain format. By giving two or three examples, the model learns the structure and style, producing outputs more aligned with your expectations.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Instruction: Generate a test case for a new feature.
	Examples:
		1. Input: Login → Test Case: Enter valid credentials → Expected: Successful login
		2. Input: Login → Test Case: Enter blank password → Expected: Show error message
New Feature: Password reset → Generate similar test cases following the above examples.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Few-shot prompting is particularly useful when task requirements are nuanced or domain-specific. By mimicking the examples, the model produces outputs that are more predictable and easier to validate.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Tip:</b>
	Quality of examples matters more than quantity. Too many examples can overwhelm the model, while high-quality, representative examples guide it effectively.
