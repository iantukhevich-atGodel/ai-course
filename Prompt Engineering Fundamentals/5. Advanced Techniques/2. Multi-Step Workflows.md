<h1>Multi-Step Workflows</h1>
<p>
	Complex tasks often require multiple reasoning steps that cannot be captured in a single prompt. Multi-step workflows involve breaking down the overall task into sequential prompts, where each step depends on the output of the previous one.
</p>
<p>
	This technique mimics human problem-solving: first, gather information; second, analyze; third, produce output. In QA workflows, this approach can be used to generate test cases, review them for completeness, and then format them for automated execution.
</p>
<ol>
	<b>Example:</b>
	<li>
		Prompt 1: “List all user inputs and possible edge cases for the login feature.”
	</li>
	<li>
		Prompt 2: “Based on the previous output, generate structured test cases in a table with columns: Input, Steps, Expected Result.”
	</li>
	<li>
		Prompt 3: “Review the test cases and add additional negative scenarios that could occur with unexpected inputs.”
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	By chaining prompts in this way, you can handle complex scenarios that would otherwise overwhelm a single prompt. This also enables more granular control over the output quality and content coverage.
