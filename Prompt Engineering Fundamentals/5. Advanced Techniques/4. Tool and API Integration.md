<h1>Tool and API Integration</h1>
<p>
	Advanced prompting is not limited to plain text instructions. By integrating external tools, APIs, or databases, prompts can interact with dynamic information or execute complex operations. For example, a prompt can call a REST API to retrieve the latest system configuration, then generate test cases based on the current environment.
</p>
<p>
	This approach extends the capabilities of language models beyond static knowledge, allowing them to respond accurately to changing conditions or integrate real-world data into the outputs. It also allows automation of workflows, such as generating scripts for test automation frameworks, without manually rewriting code.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Query the current API specification using [API endpoint]. Based on the response, generate 5 regression test cases formatted for [automation framework].
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Tool and API integration is an essential advanced technique for SDETs and QA engineers aiming to combine AI-generated outputs with automated pipelines in CI/CD environments.
