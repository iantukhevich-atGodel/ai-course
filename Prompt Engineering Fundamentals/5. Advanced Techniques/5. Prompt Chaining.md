<h1>Prompt Chaining</h1>
<p>
	Prompt chaining involves creating a sequence of dependent prompts where the output of one prompt feeds directly into the next. This is particularly useful for tasks that require refinement, stepwise reasoning, or layered outputs.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, in QA testing, you might first generate a broad set of test scenarios, then filter and organize them, and finally format them for automation. Prompt chaining allows for modular and maintainable workflows, enabling iterative improvements without rewriting the entire prompt for each step.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Prompt 1: List all possible inputs for the registration page.
Prompt 2: Generate edge-case test scenarios for each input from Prompt 1.
Prompt 3: Convert these test scenarios into structured test scripts for Selenium automation.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Prompt chaining provides a structured methodology for breaking down complex tasks, ensuring high coverage and reliability, while giving the engineer control over each stage of output generation.
