<h1>Self-Consistency in Prompting</h1>
<p>
	Self-consistency is an advanced strategy aimed at improving the reliability of model outputs by encouraging the model to generate multiple reasoning paths or answers and then select the most consistent result. This technique addresses one of the inherent challenges of large language models: the same prompt can produce different outputs on multiple attempts, especially for tasks requiring reasoning or judgment.
</p>
<p>
	For example, when generating edge-case test scenarios for a feature, a single prompt might produce a reasonable list, but it could omit certain boundary cases. By asking the model to generate several independent outputs and then comparing them, you can identify common elements that are likely correct. This approach increases confidence in the results and reduces the risk of missing critical scenarios.
</p>
<b>Example Prompt:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Generate three independent sets of test cases for the password reset feature. Then compare the outputs and identify test cases that appear in at least two sets as the most reliable.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Self-consistency is particularly useful in QA and security workflows, where precision is critical. It allows engineers to validate outputs without relying solely on human review, providing a systematic method for increasing output trustworthiness.
