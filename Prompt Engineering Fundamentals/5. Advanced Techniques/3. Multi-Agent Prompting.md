<h1>Multi-Agent Prompting</h1>
<p>
	Multi-agent prompting leverages the idea of using multiple model personas or “agents” to simulate collaboration or internal review. Each agent is assigned a specific role or perspective, and their outputs can be combined to improve accuracy, diversity, or coverage.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, one agent might generate test cases, another reviews them for missing edge cases, and a third formats them for automation. This approach allows the system to mimic teamwork, combining the strengths of multiple reasoning perspectives.
</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
	<code>
Agent 1 (QA Engineer): Generate 5 test cases for the login page.
Agent 2 (Security Analyst): Review the test cases and add scenarios for potential vulnerabilities.
Agent 3 (Automation Specialist): Format all test cases for automated execution in the testing framework.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Multi-agent prompting is particularly valuable when tasks require multiple viewpoints, ensuring that outputs are robust, comprehensive, and practical for real-world implementation.
