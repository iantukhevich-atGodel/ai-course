<h1>Data Privacy and Leakage</h1>
<p>
	Another important aspect of prompt security is data privacy. Prompts often include sensitive or proprietary information, such as system configurations, test data, or user data. If prompts are logged, shared, or stored without proper safeguards, there is a risk of data leakage.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Example:</b>
	Using production database credentials or confidential user information in a prompt to generate test data could accidentally expose sensitive data in outputs or logs. Even seemingly innocuous prompts can inadvertently include context that should remain private.
</p>
<ul>
	<p>To prevent leakage:</p>
	<li>
		Avoid including sensitive production data directly in prompts.
	</li>
	<li>
		Use anonymized or synthetic data when possible.
	</li>
	<li>
		Restrict access to prompts and outputs within controlled environments.
	</li>
	<li>
		Monitor and audit usage to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
	</li>
</ul>
