<h1>Designing Safe and Responsible Prompts</h1>
<ul>
	<p>Safe prompt design combines ethical awareness with security best practices. This includes writing prompts that:</p>
	<li>
		Clearly define tasks without relying on model assumptions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Include explicit instructions to avoid generating biased or unsafe content.
	</li>
	<li>
		Limit exposure of sensitive information.
	</li>
	<li>
		Validate or sanitize external inputs before including them in prompts.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Example:</b>
	Instead of asking the model:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
Generate test data using real user information from the database.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	A safer prompt would be:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
Generate sample test data for user accounts using anonymized values for names, emails, and passwords. Ensure diversity and neutrality in the generated data.
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	By combining clarity, context, and explicit safety instructions, prompts can produce outputs that are reliable, reproducible, and compliant with security and ethical standards.
