<h1>Integrating Ethical and Security Practices into Workflows</h1>
<ul>
	<p>For QA engineers and SDETs, ethical and security considerations should be integrated into prompt workflows rather than treated as an afterthought. This means:</p>
	<li>
		Clearly define tasks without relying on model assumptions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Include explicit instructions to avoid generating biased or unsafe content.
	</li>
	<li>
		Limit exposure of sensitive information.
	</li>
	<li>
		Validate or sanitize external inputs before including them in prompts.
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<p>
		<b>Example Workflow:</b>
	</p>
	<li>
		Draft prompt for automated test generation.
	</li>
	<li>
		Review prompt for sensitive data inclusion and bias potential.
	</li>
	<li>
		Run test outputs in a controlled environment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjust prompts or outputs based on ethical/security review.
	</li>
	<li>
		Document and monitor prompt usage in CI/CD pipelines.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Integrating these practices ensures that AI-assisted workflows remain safe, reliable, and ethically responsible.
