<h1>Historical Context</h1>
<p>Before LLMs, interacting with machines meant coding, scripting, or clicking buttons in a GUI. Models like GPT, Claude, and LLaMA changed that by letting people use natural language as the input method.</p>
<p>But natural language is messy. Humans are full of implied meaning, shortcuts, and ambiguity. For instance, if you tell a human colleague, “Can you check the login works?”, they might already know you mean: “Please test both successful and failed login scenarios, try edge cases like blank password, and maybe see if error messages make sense.”</p>
<p>A machine doesn’t have that shared context. It will either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guess (and risk being wrong), or</li>
	<li>Ask for clarification (but most LLMs don’t, unless prompted).</li>
</ul>
<p>So prompt engineering emerged as a discipline to bridge the gap between human language and machine-usable instructions.</p>
<p>It sits at the crossroads of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Natural language (how we normally speak and write)</li>
	<li>Computational instructions (what the model needs to act predictably)</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why good prompt engineers write like translators: they take a messy human request and phrase it in a way the model can execute consistently.</p>
