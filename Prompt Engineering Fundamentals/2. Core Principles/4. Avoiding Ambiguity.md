<h1>Avoiding Ambiguity</h1>
<p>
	Ambiguity is one of the most subtle and pervasive issues in prompt design. Even when a prompt seems clear to a human, it may be interpreted in multiple ways by a language model. Ambiguity leads to outputs that are inconsistent, incomplete, or irrelevant, which can slow down workflow and introduce errors.
</p>
<p>
	Common sources of ambiguity include vague verbs (“check,” “analyze”), unbounded scope (“list test cases”), and undefined formats (“explain”). Ambiguity often occurs when instructions assume the model shares context with the user, such as referring to “the system” without providing details.
</p>
<p>
	Removing ambiguity involves specifying quantities, formats, and constraints, and separating multiple instructions into discrete steps. This makes outputs reproducible and reliable, which is especially critical in professional contexts like QA, software testing, and security analysis. Learners should treat prompt refinement like debugging: test, observe outputs, and iteratively adjust the prompt until it produces consistent results.
