<h1>Role Assignment</h1>
<p>
	Language models are generalists; they do not possess intrinsic expertise in any domain. By assigning a role, you provide context that influences tone, depth, and style. This is similar to giving a colleague a specific job function before asking for help: the instructions are interpreted through the lens of their expertise.
</p>
<p>
	For example, asking 
	<code style="background-color:#ff0000; color:#000000">
		Write test cases for a login page
	</code>
	might result in a generic set of steps. Adding
	<code style="
		background-color:#000fff; 
		color:#f
	">			
		Act as a senior QA engineer
	</code>
	tells the model to produce outputs that reflect professional knowledge, consider edge cases, and use proper terminology. Role assignment can also control the perspective of the response, such as instructing the model to adopt a business analyst, security auditor, or developer point of view.
</p>
<p>
	In practice, role assignment is often combined with additional instructions to refine the output further. Without it, even a clearly written prompt may produce results that are shallow or misaligned with expectations. Learners should experiment with different roles to see how subtle changes in phrasing influence the modelâ€™s response.
