<h1>Common Mistakes in Prompt Design</h1>

<p>
	Even experienced practitioners can fall into predictable traps:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Overloading prompts with multiple or conflicting instructions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Leaving scope undefined, resulting in incomplete or inconsistent outputs.
	</li>
	<li>
		Assuming the model shares human context.
	</li>
	<li>
		Expecting a perfect result in a single attempt.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Avoiding these mistakes requires diligence and an iterative mindset. Effective prompt design combines clarity, specificity, role assignment, instruction hierarchy, and ambiguity removal. Learners should approach prompt writing as an iterative process, much like debugging code or refining a set of test cases: write, test, refine, and repeat until outputs are consistent and meet expectations.

	Practical exercises should focus on detecting these mistakes in sample prompts, rewriting them according to core principles, and observing the improvement in model outputs.
