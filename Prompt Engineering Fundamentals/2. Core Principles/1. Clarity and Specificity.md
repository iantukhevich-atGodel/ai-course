<h1>Clarity and Specificity</h1>
<p>
	Clarity and specificity are the foundation of any well-crafted prompt. Without them, even a powerful language model may produce results that are irrelevant, inconsistent, or incomplete. A clear prompt communicates exactly what you want, leaving little room for interpretation.
</p>
<p>
	Clarity is especially important in domains like QA and software engineering because ambiguous instructions can create outputs that appear correct but fail to meet the intended requirements. Specificity ensures that the model focuses on the desired scope, output format, and level of detail. For example, asking “Explain testing” is too general; the model could provide a short overview, a historical perspective, or a highly technical description, depending on what it “guesses” you mean.
</p>
<p>
	When crafting specific prompts, always define:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The scope of the task, including constraints such as number of items or depth of explanation.</li>
	<li>The format of the output, such as a table, bullet list, or paragraph.</li>
	<li>The terminology to use, especially in technical domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific prompts not only produce more relevant outputs but also reduce the need for repeated refinement. Over time, learners will notice that small changes in wording can dramatically change the output, reinforcing the importance of precise language.</p>
