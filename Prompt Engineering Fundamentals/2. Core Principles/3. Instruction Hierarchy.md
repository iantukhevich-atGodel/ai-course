<h1>Instruction Hierarchy</h1>
<p>
	Prompts frequently include multiple instructions. Without a clear hierarchy, the model may misinterpret priorities, focus on minor details, or produce an incomplete response. Instruction hierarchy organizes tasks from the most critical to the least critical elements, ensuring that the model handles the most important requirements first.
</p>
<p>
	For example, a poorly structured prompt like “Write test cases and make them short, include positive and negative, output in a table, focus on API testing” mixes priorities and may confuse the model. By contrast, a well-structured hierarchy separates the instructions into logical steps: define the task, establish scope, specify format, highlight the focus area, and set constraints.
</p>
<p>
	Hierarchical structuring also allows learners to build more complex prompts gradually. By understanding which elements are core versus optional, you can control the model’s attention and reduce errors. In QA or test automation scenarios, this can be the difference between a usable test case and an incomplete or misleading one.
