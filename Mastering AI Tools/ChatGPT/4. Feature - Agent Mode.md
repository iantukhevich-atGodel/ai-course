	Agent Mode lets ChatGPT carry out multi-step tasks on your behalf using a visual browser, code interpreter, connectors, and a terminal when supported. You describe the objective, and the agent navigates websites, fills forms, runs code, cross-references your files, and pauses for confirmations. It is built for complex, procedural work like data gathering, form-driven workflows, or bulk content edits where manual clicking would be slow. You can start it from the tools menu or by typing <code>/agent</code>, and it will surface intermediate state and request approvals. Availability and monthly limits vary by plan, with higher ceilings for Pro and business tiers.

	Once active, the agent executes in a guarded environment and uses screenshots to “see” pages as it clicks, submits, and navigates. If a task requires login, you can take over the browser safely, and cookies persist for convenience until cleared. You can schedule tasks to repeat daily, weekly, or monthly and manage schedules from a central page, which is useful for periodic audits or report generation. Controls exist for workspace owners to toggle access and set RBAC, and certain sites may be blocked for safety reasons. This balance gives you power without sacrificing governance.

	Safety is front-and-center because agents can be targeted by prompt‑injection on the web. The system includes multi-layer safeguards and best practices to reduce risk, like limiting unnecessary connectors, avoiding vague open‑ended prompts, and clearing remote browser data after sensitive sessions. Your business data on higher plans is excluded from model training by default; personal plans can manage training settings in Data Controls. You should always scope tasks narrowly, approve high-risk actions carefully, and keep an audit note of assumptions. Treat the agent as a fast assistant, not an unsupervised admin.

	In practice, teams pair Agent Mode with Web Search and Connectors to execute “find and act” missions. For example, “Search for vendor advisories this week, pull relevant ones into a table, and file a ticket with mitigations in our tracker.” The agent searches, opens links, extracts facts, writes a summary, and then creates or updates artifacts. You review and nudge it with short comments until the deliverable matches your standard. This feels like pairing with a junior analyst who is fast and consistent.

<p>
	Hands-on drill: ask the agent to gather three competing API rate-limit policies, compare them, and draft a QA impact note. Require it to cite and attach sources, then schedule the workflow to run monthly. Add a final step to email or post the note to your team once you approve. Keep a template “acceptance checklist” so you can sign off quickly each cycle. This turns an ad‑hoc chore into a dependable automation.
