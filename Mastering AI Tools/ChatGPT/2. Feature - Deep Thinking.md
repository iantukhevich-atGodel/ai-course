	Deep Thinking is ChatGPT’s “long-form reasoning” mode that trades a bit of speed for significantly better step-by-step analysis on hard problems. In practice, the system decides when to “think longer” based on your prompt, and you’ll see a slimmed-down reasoning view while it works. GPT‑5 can switch between standard chat and thinking automatically, or you can explicitly select the Thinking option in the model picker when precision matters. This mode is ideal for decomposing multi-constraint tasks in QA, test planning, data triage, or complex bug analysis where a shallow draft would miss edge cases. It’s available across ChatGPT tiers with higher limits and options on paid plans, and it’s designed to deliver more reliable answers on difficult work.

	Under the hood, the platform exposes a <code>reasoning.effort</code> control in the API that guides how many “reasoning tokens” the model burns before writing the answer. Setting this to <em>low</em> favors speed and economy, while <em>high</em> favors deeper chains of thought and more complete solutions, and the ChatGPT UI mirrors this by offering quick vs thinking options. For day-to-day testing tasks, start with the default and only escalate when you see ambiguity, missing justifications, or conflicting requirements. For deep fault isolation or risk-based test design, use Thinking mode right away so the model enumerates assumptions, constraints, and test oracles. This setting gives you predictable, repeatable behavior across sessions when you need auditability.

	To get the most out of Deep Thinking, structure prompts that force the model to map the problem before proposing code or steps. Ask for “constraints, risks, unknowns, and plan” first, then “implementation or test cases” second, and finally “validation and rollback” as a third pass. When you need traceability, request a short rationale summary that lists the decisions it made and the evidence used, and keep it to bullet-light prose for readability. Reserve full-length rationales for internal notes or attached files if your team requires longer write-ups. Use the same scaffolding for bug reproduction, where the model should propose minimal repros, instrumentation, and <em>observability-first</em> checks before edits.

	Here is a quick practice loop used by many QA teams. First, present a fuzzy requirement or defect report and ask the model to summarize intent and ambiguity. Second, switch to Thinking and request a risk matrix plus edge-case buckets. Third, ask it to synthesize a lean test plan with explicit pass/fail oracles and data setup steps. Finally, have it produce a short “assumptions and hazards” memo you can paste into your ticket. This balances speed with depth while preserving artifacts you can review with peers.

When collaborating, combine Thinking mode with Projects and files so the model reuses context across sessions. Attach your specs, log excerpts, and sample data, and instruct the model to cross-reference them before proposing actions. Keep the same naming for artifacts between chats to reduce context drift, and pin final decisions to a single “source-of-truth” note that later prompts must honor. If performance dips, drop back to fast answers to iterate on structure, then re-enable Thinking for the final pass. This pattern keeps velocity high without sacrificing rigor on sign-off steps.
