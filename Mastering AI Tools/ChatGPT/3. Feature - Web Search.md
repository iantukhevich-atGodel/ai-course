	Web Search lets ChatGPT fetch fresh, cited information when your question benefits from the open web. You can enable it from “View all tools” → Search, trigger it inline with the “/” shortcut, or let ChatGPT escalate automatically when it detects that recency matters. Search responses include inline citations you can hover to preview and click to open sources, which is essential when your QA decision depends on external standards, platform changes, or API deprecations. On mobile and desktop, you can also regenerate and explicitly request a new search pass if the first result set is thin. This keeps your investigations reproducible and verifiable.

	Behind the scenes, ChatGPT may rewrite your prompt into multiple targeted queries and route them to search partners, then synthesize the answer with citations. It can also use your general location to improve relevance for queries like “labs near me” without sharing your IP address itself. If Memory is enabled, the system may fold in remembered preferences to craft better queries, which is helpful when your team always targets a specific framework or environment. Results often include a Sources panel so you can scan links beyond the inline citations. These design choices aim to expose provenance without slowing you down.

	Use Web Search for fast standards checks, security advisories, or vendor policy updates that move faster than internal docs. Start by asking for a brief synthesis and the top three primary sources, then follow up with “differences and implications for testing” to drive from facts to action. When you spot conflicts between sources, request a side‑by‑side delta with publication dates and the specific statements that disagree. If you need code-level consequences, chain a final prompt that converts the differences into failing tests or guardrails. This preserves a crisp trail from evidence to test enforcement.

	Pair Search with Projects and Connectors when you want web results reconciled against internal truth. For example, instruct: “Search the web for Playwright 1.x → 1.y breaking changes and compare against our e2e fixtures in <em>repo-X</em> and the QA checklist in <em>drive:/QA/ReleaseNotes</em>.” Ask the model to output a short “impact matrix” that lists tests to add, tests to update, and risks to accept. Because citations are embedded, reviewers can spot-check external claims quickly. This pattern tightens external drift control without endless link-chasing.

	Practice drill: give ChatGPT a policy question where correctness matters, e.g., “Does framework Z still ship Type A cookies by default?” Ask it to search, list sources with dates, and summarize the change history. Next, tell it to map each change to a test assertion and provide code for your stack. Finally, have it write a one-paragraph release note you can drop into your internal wiki. Repeat the exercise quarterly to maintain guardrails as vendors ship updates.
