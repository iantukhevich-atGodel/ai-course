	ChatGPT is an advanced conversational AI system developed by OpenAI, designed to interpret prompts, generate responses, and assist users across a wide range of tasks. From simple question answering to complex reasoning and software development support, it has become a cornerstone tool in modern AI-driven workflows. For Quality Management teams, ChatGPT is particularly valuable in automating repetitive documentation, analyzing patterns in test logs, and accelerating the design of test plans or frameworks.

	At its core, ChatGPT operates on a family of models collectively referred to as GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). Each version—GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and now GPT-5—builds upon the architecture of the transformer neural network. This design enables the model to process massive datasets, detect contextual relationships in text, and generate human-like responses. The latest iteration, GPT-5, excels in reasoning, memory, and adaptability compared to earlier models, making it more reliable in professional and technical contexts.

	When using ChatGPT, it is important to understand the 
	<b>model selection process</b>. 
	Users may choose between faster but lighter models (such as GPT-3.5) for quick iterative tasks, or more powerful models (GPT-4 and GPT-5) when accuracy and reasoning depth matter most. For example, a QM engineer generating a large set of automated test cases may prefer GPT-5 for accuracy, while GPT-3.5 could be sufficient for brainstorming bug title suggestions.

	The evolution of ChatGPT also introduced multimodal capabilities, enabling it to process not just text but also images, code snippets, and structured data. This means that testers can upload screenshots of failed UI tests or log files, and the AI can reason over them directly. This multimodality makes ChatGPT far more powerful than traditional text-only assistants.
</p>
<p>
	To illustrate this, imagine a workflow where a tester uploads a log file from a failed build. GPT-5 not only summarizes the errors but correlates them with previously reported issues. This leap in contextual understanding is a direct result of model evolution. Over time, ChatGPT has shifted from being a “chatbot” into a dynamic
