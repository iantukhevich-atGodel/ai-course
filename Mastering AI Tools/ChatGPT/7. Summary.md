	In practice, mastering ChatGPT means mastering <i>when</i> to use each 
	<a href='https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9260256-chatgpt-capabilities-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>capability</a>. 
	Use GPT‑5’s default routing for rapid drafting; switch to Thinking when precision matters; pull <b>Search</b> for live facts; escalate to <b>Deep Research</b> for multi‑source syntheses; ground answers with <b>Projects</b> and <b>Connectors</b>; iterate deliverables in <b>Canvas</b>; and hand structured coding work to <b>Codex</b>. This toolchain turns ChatGPT from a smart chat window into an <i>operational assistant</i> embedded in your QA lifecycle. 
</p>

<p>
	A daily 30‑minute routine could look like: open your <a href='https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>Release Project</a>; 
	ask for an overnight failure digest; run Search for any dependency notices; use Canvas to update the risk log; ask Agent to file owner‑tagged tasks; and schedule Codex to apply templated fixes for recurring issues. Over a sprint, these micro‑automations compound into measurable time savings and fewer escapes to production. The point isn’t to replace engineering judgment but to amplify it with repeatable, auditable steps.
</p>

<p>
	As your team advances, codify prompts and checklists: define your defect taxonomy, “definition of done” for test cases, and escalation templates as Project instructions so ChatGPT internalizes your standards. This reduces variability across contributors and shortens onboarding for new hires. Pair that with connectors scoped to least privilege, and you get a reliable, governed augmentation layer over your existing tools.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, keep quality bars high by asking for outputs with structure and citations: tables of risks, step‑by‑step isolation plans, and linked sources for any external claims. When using agentic features, insist on summaries of actions taken and artifacts changed, just like you would in a change‑management ticket. This makes AI‑assisted QA traceable and easier to defend in audits. 
</p>

<p>
	Your next step: create a Project for your current release, upload two recent logs and your master test plan, and run a combined Deep Thinking + Search session asking for a prioritized mitigation plan with cited evidence and a Canvas‑ready draft report. This single exercise will expose you to the full stack—files, reasoning, browsing, editing—and deliver tangible value on day one.
