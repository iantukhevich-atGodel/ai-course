	Canvas is a focused workspace that opens beside your chat for writing and coding tasks that benefit from inline editing and revision. You can type directly in the canvas, ask for targeted edits, and get inline comments and quick actions that keep your flow tight. It’s available on Web, Windows, and macOS, with mobile support on the way, and ChatGPT may open a canvas automatically when your output is long or code-heavy. You can also request “open a canvas” or “open a coding canvas” explicitly when you want a structured editing surface. This blends chat guidance with a proper editing pane so teams can converge on clean drafts faster.

	Canvas shines because you control selection, scope, and context. Highlight a paragraph or a block to ask for improvements, bug fixes, or refactors, and the assistant will propose changes without losing sight of the whole. Shortcuts speed up common moves like suggest edits, adjust length, add comments, and code review. For QA or SDET work, this lets you iterate on test docs, fixtures, or auxiliary scripts while capturing rationale right next to the edits. It feels like code review and pair writing in one place.

<p>
	For code, Canvas can render React/HTML previews and execute Python in-browser with a console, making small experiments quick and visible. Enterprise admins can control code execution and network access defaults to meet compliance needs, and web previews will prompt before contacting third‑party sites. If you get a console error, click the “Fix bug” shortcut to have ChatGPT propose patch diffs and try again. This reduces context switching to external terminals for many small tasks. Use it to validate repro snippets or confirm minimal failing cases before full commits.

	Version history in Canvas lets you navigate and restore prior drafts, and a Show changes view highlights additions and deletions. You can export documents as PDF/Markdown/Word and code canvases in language‑appropriate files for handoff. Sharing a canvas works like sharing a chat, which is great for async collaboration or supervisor sign‑off. You can also enable Canvas capability for your custom GPTs so their users can open canvases during a chat. These ergonomics make it a natural fit for team workflows.

<p>
	Practice: paste a flaky test file into a coding canvas and ask for a “stability pass without changing intent.” Request inline comments explaining each edit and a final diff view to review. Then export the file, attach the reasoning snippet to your PR, and ask for a peer review. Repeat the loop with a spec document to standardize headings, acceptance criteria, and risk notes. This builds a reusable pattern for both code and docs.
