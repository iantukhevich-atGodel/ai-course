	Codex is OpenAI’s developer-focused toolchain that integrates with ChatGPT to help you read, write, run, and review code across local and cloud workflows. It brings code understanding, PR assistance, repo indexing, and terminal‑style actions into a cohesive experience, complementing ChatGPT’s general reasoning. You can enable Codex features from ChatGPT on desktop and web, and connect it to GitHub for workflow‑aware reviews. For organizations, Codex plays well with enterprise controls and can be scoped to specific repos or environments. Think of it as your “software engineering mode” built into ChatGPT.

	Teams use Codex to accelerate code comprehension, generate safe scaffolds, and produce reviewable diffs backed by explanations. When combined with Projects and file uploads, Codex maintains context across sessions so the assistant remembers design decisions and test conventions. It can draft PR descriptions, propose test expansions, and flag risky changes, with a workflow that stays inside your existing tools. Because it’s attached to ChatGPT, you can pivot between planning, code, and documentation without juggling apps. This is especially useful for QA engineers who own both tests and release notes.

	Security and governance are first-class. Enterprise admins can constrain what Codex can access, define allowed operations, and route actions through audited environments. You can align Codex with your compliance posture by limiting network access, enforcing review gates, and disabling sensitive commands. These controls help you benefit from AI velocity without expanding the blast radius. Document these boundaries in your internal playbook and keep the defaults conservative.

	When paired with GitHub, Codex can participate in 
	<a href='https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/code-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>PR review</a> 
	with targeted suggestions and test-impact notes. Ask it to focus on specific files, performance hotspots, or security rules, and require it to include minimal reproducible examples for any bug claims. It can cross‑reference repository context and your prompt instructions to propose actionable fixes rather than generic feedback. Use it as a second reviewer that never gets tired but still demands your final judgment. This keeps standards high while reducing toil.
</p>
<p>
	Try this drill: feed Codex a medium‑sized module and request “explain architecture, identify implicit contracts, and propose three safe refactors with tests.” Ask for a staged plan: comprehension → refactor proposals → patch diffs → tests → rollback plan. Then have it produce a short changelog entry and release‑note snippet. Finally, run a “red team” prompt: “List risks introduced by these changes and how to detect them in CI.” This pattern turns AI suggestions into managed engineering change.
