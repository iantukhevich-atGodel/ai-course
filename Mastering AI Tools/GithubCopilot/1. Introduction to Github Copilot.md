<p>
	<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>GitHub Copilot</a>
	is an AI coding companion embedded directly in your IDE and on GitHub.com. Unlike a general chat interface, Copilot observes your in‑editor context—cursor position, surrounding code, file tree—and proposes completions, edits, and explanations inline. It also powers <i>Copilot Chat</i> for conversational assistance tied to the current repository, so you can ask questions, generate tests, or explain a diff right where you work.
</p>

<p>
	Copilot supports multiple underlying AI <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>models</a> with different trade‑offs in latency, reasoning, and quality. You can compare models side‑by‑side and pick the one suited for your task—lighter models for snappy completions and heavier models for complex refactors or design reviews. Understanding model behavior helps you choose the right tool for “autocomplete a helper” versus “explain this concurrency bug.” 
</p>

<p>
	For organizations on Copilot Enterprise, 
	<a href='https://github.blog/changelog/2024-08-27-custom-models-for-github-copilot-are-now-in-limited-public-beta/?utm_source=chatgpt.com'><b>custom models</b></a>
	allow fine‑tuning on your own codebases to align suggestions with house style, frameworks, and security rules. Admins can govern access via enterprise controls (including bring‑your‑own‑key) and decide which teams can use which models. This reduces friction in code reviews because generated code already matches your conventions. 
</p>

<p>
	Plan selection matters: Copilot Pro is aimed at individuals who want premium models, coding agent access, and unlimited completions; Enterprise layers on governance, SSO, and organization‑wide controls. Teams can start small on Pro for pilots, then graduate to Enterprise once they need policy and compliance features.
</p>

<p>
	A pragmatic adoption path: start with default models in a pilot repo, capture friction points in reviews, then trial a custom model trained on your most representative services. Measure acceptance rate of suggestions, time‑to‑green for PRs, and defect escape rate. Use those
	<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>metrics</a>
	to justify scaling to more teams and integrating Copilot with CI quality gates.
