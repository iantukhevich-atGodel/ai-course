	Copilot’s autocomplete delivers inline 
	<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/completions/code-suggestions'>code suggestions</a> 
	as you type across popular IDEs, with multi-line completions and “next edit suggestions” that anticipate your next change. It works especially well for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C#, and C++, and it can also help with SQL and infrastructure code. The feature respects organizational policies and can flag matches to public code with references when enabled. You can switch completion models in VS Code, JetBrains, or Visual Studio when alternatives are available. Treat autocomplete as a fast draft that you immediately compile and test.
</p>

<p>
	For best results, write intention-revealing comments and small function shells so Copilot has anchors for structure and naming. When suggestions are close but unsafe, accept partially and refactor, or press tab to cycle options. Use short, descriptive variable names and keep the active file focused on one responsibility so the model learns the pattern. If a suggestion seems too generic, add a “must” constraint in a nearby comment, such as complexity limits or API calls that must be used. This shapes the distribution of plausible completions toward your target. 
</p>

<p>
	Autocomplete is not just for new code; it accelerates editing runs like logging, input validation, and error handling. In refactors, use it to propagate signature changes or rewrite boilerplate across similar blocks. When you see the model hallucinate APIs, nudge it with a tiny example above the cursor that compiles in your project. Keep unit tests open so you can run them after accepting a larger chunk. Continuous feedback tightens the loop and improves suggestion quality over time. 
</p>

<p>
	Language coverage is broad, but quality varies with ecosystem maturity and your repository’s patterns. If you need a different trade‑off, 
	<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/change-the-completion-model'>change the completion model</a>
	via the command palette in VS Code or equivalent controls in your IDE. Note that availability of alternative models changes over time, and previews can appear in the picker. Use a small benchmark set—five files with typical tasks—to compare acceptance rate and post‑edit churn. Lock in your team’s default when the data favors it. 
</p>

<p>
	Exercise: in a fresh branch, create a small feature flag helper and rely on autocomplete to fill out tests and call sites. Track time-to-green and number of keystrokes saved, and capture any unsafe suggestions. Repeat with a second model from the picker and compare. This gives you a local, objective signal for which model serves your codebase best.
