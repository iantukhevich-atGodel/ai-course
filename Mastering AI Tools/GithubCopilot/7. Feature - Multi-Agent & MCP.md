	<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/about-mcp'>The Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>
	is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to tools and data, and Copilot uses it to extend Chat and Agents. With MCP, Copilot can talk to local or remote servers that expose tools like “search,” “fetch,” or domain‑specific actions. GitHub provides a GitHub MCP server for repo‑aware operations, and you can add others for internal systems. Enterprises can govern MCP usage with policies; access is disabled by default in many org contexts. This makes Copilot more capable while preserving administrative control.
</p>

<p>
	You can configure MCP with Copilot Chat in supported IDEs to query systems, pull context, and perform safe actions. Remote servers offer easy setup via OAuth or tokens, while local servers can reach on‑prem resources under your policies. The GitHub MCP server supports installing toolsets in read‑only or read/write modes so you can tailor capabilities. Editors like VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio, Xcode, and others have growing support for remote MCP servers. Choose the minimal set you need and document who may enable each server.

	Agent Mode can also
	<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/enhance-agent-mode-with-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>be enhanced</a>
	with MCP so edit sessions can call external tools responsibly. Tutorials show how to wire MCP into agent mode and expose only the operations your team sanctions. For orgs on Enterprise/Business, MCP server use can be toggled in policy and is off by default. Keep logs and alerts around any write‑capable tools, and prefer read‑only for exploration. Treat MCP like an API gateway for your AI assistants.

	you can connect to the hosted option via OAuth in VS Code or run it locally for maximum control. Tool configuration lets you pick which GitHub capabilities are available, such as issue creation or code scanning, and push protection helps prevent leaking secrets in AI‑generated responses. Start in a sandbox repo, confirm governance works, then expand to critical projects. This staged rollout minimizes risk while you learn.
</p>

<p>
	Exercise: create a tiny MCP server that exposes a “test-catalog” tool and connect it to Copilot Chat. Ask for “generate tests for feature X using catalog Y,” then have the agent convert the plan into a PR in a playground repo. Review, request changes, and merge if acceptable. Document the server contract and enable it for your team only after reviews. This demonstrates safe, practical multi‑agent orchestration.
